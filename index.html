						<p id="intro">Long before I met the woman I would marry I met the friends (<a href="#Freddie">Freddie</a>, <a href="#Tyler">Tyler</a>, <a href="#Lamorne">Lamorne</a>, <a href="#Angelo">Angelo</a> &amp; <a href="#Justin">Justin</a>) that would be by my side
on that day. These guys and I have been through good times, bad times, and countless
crazy times, but we’ve (surprisingly) survived it all. When it came to choosing groomsmen there was no doubt these six will be standing up there with me on November 24, 2017.

						<h2>Freddie - My Best Man</h2>
						<img id="Freddie"src="images/Freddie.jpg" alt="Freddie"style="width:400px;height:400px;">
						<p class="summary">Freddie has always been and will always be my favorite beer pong partner. He
cares a lot about his appearance and fancies himself a Drake lookalike. Some of his
favorite things include mirror selfies and snapchats of his car. There are very few people
in the world that know less about sports than Freddie but some how even with all these terrible traits he is still my best friend and my best man.

						<a name="Tyler">
						<h2>Tyler - Groomsman</h2>
						<img class="left" src="images/Tyler.jpg" alt="Tyler"style="width:400px;height:400px;">
						<p class="summary">Tyler is mean, witty, opinionated, and gossips like a teenage girl. There is no way to
avoid laughing at his jokes, even when you are the punchline. He’s a person you want
on your side in a fight, believe me, I’ve seen him lift an enormous dumpster. Most
importantly Tyler can outdrink anyone I know but please never give him Jäger.

						<h2>Lamorne - Groomsman</h2>
						<img class="right" src="images/Lamorne.jpg" alt="Lamorne"style="width:400px;height:400px;">
						<p class="summary">
						When Lamorne is around you are sure to have a good time. He’s the life of every party, whether he’s dancing or telling one of the most elaborate stories you’ve ever heard he’s making the whole room laugh.

						<a name="Angelo">
						<h2>Angelo - Groomsman</h2>
						<img class="left" src="images/Angelo.jpg" alt="Angelo"style="width:400px;height:400px;">
						<p class="summary">Angelo and I met in elementary school making him one of my oldest friends. We went
from playing at recess together to being in the same graduating high school class. If I ever need help with anything I know I can call him and he will be there with a smile asking what he can do. He is hands down the nicest of my friends and anyone who knows him would say that same thing.

						<a name="Justin">
						<h2>Justin - Groomsman</h2>
						<img class="right" src="images/Justin.jpg" alt="Justin"style="width:400px;height:400px;">
						<p class="summary">Justin and I grew up in the same neighborhood. We went from playing sports outside all
day to video games all night. As a teenager I spent more time at his house than my own, his family became mine. Years have passed but whenever we get together it is like old times all over again.
